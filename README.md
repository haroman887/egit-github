# Eclipse EGit GitHub Connector

_EGit GitHub Connector_ is an Eclipse plugin for working with Git repositories
hosted on Github. It is based on the _JGit_ library, which is a Git implementation
in pure Java, and integrates with EGit, which is the Eclipse Git Team Provider, and
uses the Mylyn framework.

This package is licensed under the _EPL 2.0_ . Please refer to the `LICENSE` file
for the complete license.

## Compatibility

- In general, EGit supports at least the latest two Eclipse releases.
  For details, please see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ

- Newer version of EGit may implement new functionality, remove
  existing functions and change others without other notice than what
  is written in the commit log and source files themselves.

- The EGit GitHub Connector uses the GitHub REST API v3.
